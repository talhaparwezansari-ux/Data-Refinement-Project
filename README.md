# Data-Refinement-Project
I learned that large datasets are ineffective without strong coding and logical implementation. Real-world data is often unstructured and inconsistent, making data cleaning essential. This Data Refinement Project shows how proper cleaning improves accuracy, and I plan to extend it with frontend features and machine learning integration.
